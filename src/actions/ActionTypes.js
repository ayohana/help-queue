// ACTION CONSTANTS =============================

export const ADD_TICKET = 'ADD_TICKET';
export const DELETE_TICKET = 'DELETE_TICKET';
export const TOGGLE_FORM = 'TOGGLE_FORM';

// React and Redux aren't opinionated about where we store these constants. Since we'll only be using them in our action creators - and because these specific constants will define action types - we will store them in our actions directory in a file called ActionTypes.js.
