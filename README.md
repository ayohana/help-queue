## Notes

* **The Virtual DOM**

  1. **React Creates its own Virtual DOM
  React is declarative**, which means we only need to declare what our UI should like. React will handle the rest. When we create React elements (such as a header or paragraph), we're actually creating new elements in the virtual DOM, not the real DOM. Creating and updating this virtual DOM is much faster than updating the actual DOM because it doesn't require communication with the browser.

  2. **React Compares the "Actual" DOM to its Virtual DOM.**
  After crafting its own virtual DOM, React then compares it to the "actual" DOM in the browser, noting any differences between the two.

  3. **React Calculates Changes.** React then automatically calculates the least number of changes necessary to update the actual DOM to match its virtual DOM. This process is known as reconciliation.

  4. **React Updates Actual DOM.** React then updates the real DOM to match the virtual DOM only once. This is much faster than calling the DOM multiple times, making each small change individually.

  5. **Repeat.** This process repeats as the user interacts with the application. React continues to update its own virtual DOM as users complete actions that warrant updates to the user interface. While it's important to have a basic understanding of how the virtual DOM works, React will take care of the heavy lifting for us and allow us to create very efficient sites with relatively little code.

* Several key points of **React Components**:

  * **Functional components** are literally functions that returns a React element. They can't store or alter state. We will mostly write functional components.

  * **Class components** are classes that extend React's Component class. They must always include a render() method that will return a React element. They are used when we need state.

  * **Nesting components** is a big part of developing with React. Components can be parents, siblings, children or any combination thereof.

  * Small, **modular components** are the way to go. This makes our code easier to understand and allows us to separate presentational concerns.

* Storing all components in a `components` directory is considered a best practice. However, note that index.js should not be added to our new `components` directory.

* Note that `Header.js` is capitalized. It is standard naming convention to capitalize component names.

* Generally, we will want our state to live in one place and be _the single source of truth_. Instead of each `Ticket.js` storing its own data (which wouldn't be a single source of truth), we'll have a parent component store all of the ticket data - that way, our state will be stored in one place.

* React components accept properties (known as **props**) passed down from a parent. Because React components are functions, these props are actually just a special kind of argument.

* **Props Are Read-Only.** React components aren't just functions - they are _pure functions_. As we know from our functional programming week, pure functions don't have side effects and don't alter state. We need to follow these same rules when we are working with props. We will **never alter the value of props** because this would alter the state of our application and break a cardinal rule of pure functions: no side effects. For that reason, it's very important to remember that **props are read-only.**

  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

  ## Available Scripts

  In the project directory, you can run:

  ### `npm start`

  Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
  You will also see any lint errors in the console.

  ### `npm test`

  Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
  See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  ### `npm run build`

  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
  It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
  Your app is ready to be deployed!

  See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  ### `npm run eject`

  **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

  If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

  Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

  You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
